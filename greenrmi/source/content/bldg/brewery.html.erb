		<p>The new brewery is part of the 11,500-square-foot August A. Busch III Brewing and Food Science Laboratory. The brewery has been designated LEED Platinum, meeting the highest environmental standards of the Green Building Council.</p>
		<p>It is an authentic, reduced-scale facility, similar in size to smaller commercial brewing operations.  Equipment for the 1.5-barrel–capacity brewery, updated in 2006, was relocated from Cruess Hall in 2010.</p>

<p>"The new facility will allow us to showcase the importance of beer and brewing as a complex, sophisticated process, as well as the important role that UC Davis plays in the brewing industry,” said Charlie Bamforth, Anheuser-Busch Endowed Professor of Malting and Brewing in the Department of Food Science and Technology.</p>

<p>“We hope that it will be a facility that can be used by commercial brewers and suppliers to test out new recipes or processes in small-scale batches,” he adds.</p>
